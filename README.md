# JAVA-Project
The objective of the project is to create a platform for sales and purchase of “PERISHABLE” goods like fruits and vegetables. Currently the process is carried out by traders at district levels and cities with the last mile distribution done by retail vendors. The drawback with this system is that the sales price derived at any point factors in the risk of wastage since it might not be sold and goods being perishable. If the quantity to be sold is confirmed the entire trade system can be operated at lower risk coverage which benefits all stakeholders of the system
